     * used as transport. The client may withdraw more than one socket from the factory and
     * may re-use the sockets on its own
     *
     * \param f -- the factory pointer
     * \param max_connections -- maximum number of connection a client is allowed to maintain
     * (both active and cached in pool)
     * \param retry -- whether or not to retry requests on connection IO errors
     *
     * The client uses connections provided by factory to send requests over and receive responses
     * back. Once request-response cycle is over the connection used for that is kept by a client
     * in a "pool". Making another http request may then pick up the existing connection from the
     * pool thus avoiding the extra latency of establishing new connection. Pool may thus accumulate
     * more than one connection if user sends several requests in parallel.
     *
     * HTTP servers may sometimes want to terminate the connections it keeps. This can happen in
     * one of several ways.
     *
     * The "gentle" way is when server adds the "connection: close" header to its response. In that
     * case client would handle the response and will just close the connection without putting it
     * to pool.
     *
     * Less gentle way a server may terminate a connection is by closing it, so the underlying TCP
     * stack would communicate regular TCP FIN-s. If the connection happens to be in pool when it
     * happens the client would just clean the connection from pool in the background.
     *
     * Sometimes the least gentle closing occurs when server closes the connection on the fly and
     * TCP starts communicating FIN-s in parallel with client using it. In that case, user would
     * receive exception from the \ref make_request() call and will have to do something about it.
     * Client provides a transparent way of handling it called "retry".
     *
     * When enabled, it makes client catch the transport error, close the broken connection, open
     * another one and retry the very same request one more time over this new connection. If the
     * second attempt fails, this error is reported back to user.
