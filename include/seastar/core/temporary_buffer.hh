/// Temporary, self-managed byte buffer.
///
/// A \c temporary_buffer is similar to an \c std::string or a \c std::unique_ptr<char[]>,
/// but provides more flexible memory management.  A \c temporary_buffer can own the memory
/// it points to, or it can be shared with another \c temporary_buffer, or point at a substring
/// of a buffer.  It uses a \ref deleter to manage its memory.
///
/// A \c temporary_buffer should not be held indefinitely.  It can be held while a request
/// is processed, or for a similar duration, but not longer, as it can tie up more memory
/// that its size indicates.
///
/// A buffer can be shared: two \c temporary_buffer objects will point to the same data,
/// or a subset of it.  See the \ref temporary_buffer::share() method.
///
/// Unless you created a \c temporary_buffer yourself, do not modify its contents, as they
/// may be shared with another user that does not expect the data to change.
///
/// Use cases for a \c temporary_buffer include:
///  - passing a substring of a tcp packet for the user to consume (zero-copy
///    tcp input)
///  - passing a refcounted blob held in memory to tcp, ensuring that when the TCP ACK
///    is received, the blob is released (by decrementing its reference count) (zero-copy
///    tcp output)
///
/// \tparam CharType underlying character type (must be a variant of \c char).
